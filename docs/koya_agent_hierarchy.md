# Inter-Agent Collaboration Model

## Hierarchical Relationships
- Executive Agents (Faz, Mindy, Barry) provide strategic direction and oversight
- Specialized Agents execute specific functions and report to their Executive
- Cross-functional teams form for each client campaign
- Knowledge flows vertically (strategic guidance down, results up) and horizontally (collaboration across domains)

## Campaign Workflow
For each client campaign, relevant agents from each domain collaborate in synchronized workflows:

1. **Discovery & Strategy Phase**
   - Led by Front Office (Faz)
   - Primary agents: Market Analyst, Brand Strategist, Audience Specialist, Campaign Strategist, Account Director

2. **Creative Development Phase**
   - Led by Middle Office (Mindy)
