# Koya: An Architecture for AI-Native Advertising

Koya represents a new paradigm in advertising, where AI agents don't merely assist human professionals but constitute the core operational workforce of the agency. Our architecture draws inspiration from two complementary sources: the Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents (CoALA) framework, which provides the theoretical foundation for how agents think and operate, and OpenAI's Practical Guide to Building Agents, which offers concrete implementation approaches. Together, these frameworks inform a comprehensive blueprint for our AI-native advertising agency.

At its heart, Koya's architecture mirrors human cognitive processes while leveraging the unique capabilities of artificial intelligence. Each agent in our system possesses three fundamental cognitive components: memory systems that store and retrieve information, action spaces that define what the agent can do, and decision procedures that determine how choices are made. This cognitive triad forms the foundation upon which we build specialized advertising expertise.

Memory serves as the bedrock of our architecture. Agents maintain both working memory for current tasks and long-term memory for accumulated knowledge and experiences. A media planning agent, for instance, holds active campaign requirements in working memory while drawing upon historical performance data from long-term memory. This dual-memory system allows agents to maintain focus on immediate tasks while leveraging past experiences and domain knowledge. Memory isn't merely passive storage but an active system that encodes, organizes, and retrieves information based on relevance and importance, much like human memory consolidation processes.

The action space defines each agent's capabilities within the advertising ecosystem. We distinguish between internal actions—like reasoning, planning, and reflection—and external actions such as gathering information, communicating with clients, or producing creative assets. Each specialized agent possesses a carefully curated set of actions relevant to their role. A copywriter agent has robust internal actions for ideation and narrative development, paired with external actions for producing and refining text. This separation of internal and external actions allows for both deep cognitive processing and effective real-world interaction.

Decision procedures form the executive function of our architecture. Through structured planning processes, agents break down complex advertising challenges into manageable components, develop strategies to address them, and systematically execute solutions. A campaign strategist agent might decompose a brand awareness objective into audience identification, message development, and channel strategy components, then methodically address each element. Throughout execution, agents continuously monitor progress, adapt to feedback, and refine their approach, creating a dynamic decision cycle that mirrors professional advertising workflows.

Perhaps most critically, our architecture embraces observability and hierarchy. Every agent operates within a transparent framework where their activities, reasoning, and decisions can be monitored at appropriate levels of detail. This transparency extends through our five-level observability system, where executives have comprehensive views of their domains while you, as CEO, maintain visibility across the entire organization. This observability doesn't just facilitate oversight; it enables continuous learning and improvement as successful patterns are identified and replicated.

The social dimension of our architecture manifests in carefully designed orchestration patterns. Agents don't work in isolation but collaborate in structured workflows mirroring traditional agency processes. Some collaborations follow the manager pattern, where executive agents like Faz coordinate specialized front office agents. Others employ a decentralized approach, where peer agents hand off work directly to one another, such as when a copywriter transfers finalized content to a media specialist for placement. These collaboration patterns create an interconnected system that functions cohesively despite being composed of specialized components.

Throughout this architecture, we've maintained clear integration points for human guidance and partnership. While Koya is AI-native, it's designed for meaningful human collaboration, with deliberate approval workflows, feedback mechanisms, and intervention capabilities. You, as the human CEO, provide strategic direction and ultimate oversight, while the AI executive team translates your vision into coordinated action across the organization.

In essence, Koya's architecture represents a cognitive ecosystem where specialized agents with distinct memories, capabilities, and decision processes work together within a transparent, hierarchical structure. By combining theoretical cognitive principles with practical implementation approaches, we've created a framework that promises to deliver the creativity and strategic thinking of traditional advertising with the efficiency, scalability, and data-driven precision that only AI can provide. This architecture doesn't merely automate existing processes—it reimagines what an advertising agency can be when built from the ground up with artificial intelligence at its core.
