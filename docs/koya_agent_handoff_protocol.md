# Koya Agent Handoff Protocol

## Fifth Grade Explanation:
This document explains how our AI helpers pass work to each other, like runners in a relay race passing a baton. It shows what information they share and how they make sure nothing gets dropped during the handoff.

## High School Explanation:
This document details the standardized protocol for work transitions between agents in the Koya system. It defines the message structure, validation requirements, acknowledgment procedures, and error handling mechanisms that ensure reliable and efficient workflow progression across the agency's agent network.

## Overview

The Koya Agent Handoff Protocol (KAHP) establishes a standardized framework for work transitions between agents throughout the Koya AI-native agency. This protocol ensures consistent, reliable handoffs while maintaining context integrity, proper prioritization, and complete knowledge transfer during workflow transitions.

## Core Protocol Components

### 1. Handoff Message Structure

Every agent handoff is encapsulated in a standardized message structure that includes all essential information for the receiving agent to continue the workflow successfully.

#### Required Message Components:

- **Header**
  - `handoff_id`: Unique identifier for this specific handoff
  - `source_agent`: Identifier of the originating agent
  - `target_agent`: Identifier of the receiving agent
  - `workflow_id`: Identifier of the overall workflow this handoff belongs to
  - `campaign_id`: Identifier of the client campaign
  - `timestamp`: ISO 8601 datetime of handoff initiation
  - `priority_level`: Integer value (1-5) indicating urgency
  - `expected_completion`: ISO 8601 datetime for expected completion
  - `handoff_type`: Category indicator (standard, expedited, revision, etc.)

### 2. Handoff Validation Framework

Before a handoff is considered complete, it undergoes a validation process to ensure all necessary information and artifacts are included.

#### Validation Categories:

   - Delivery of all required artifacts
   - Summary of actions taken and decisions made
   - Pointers to the next workflow stage if applicable

### 4. Exception Handling Framework

A structured approach for managing exceptions during the handoff process ensures that issues are promptly addressed.

#### Exception Categories and Responses:

- **Clarity Exceptions**
