   - Established unit and integration test directories
   - Implemented GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD

2. **Initial Tests**
   - Created unit tests for Campaign model
   - Implemented integration tests for campaigns API
   - Resolved package imports through setup.py

### Phase 3: Agent Communication (Completed)

1. **Basic Communication Protocol**
   - Implemented StandardCommunicationProtocol for message routing
   - Created CommunicatingAgentImpl for concrete agent implementation
   - Added conversation tracking and message queue management

2. **Domain-Specific Agents**
   - Developed CampaignManagerAgent and CreativeAgent
   - Implemented specialized message types for ad agency operations
   - Created agent collaboration patterns for campaign workflow

3. **Example Implementations**
   - Built basic and advanced examples of agent communication
   - Created ad agency example demonstrating campaign lifecycle
   - Developed demo script for showcasing agent interactions

### Phase 4: Metrics and Observability (Completed)

1. **Metrics Collection**
   - Designed interfaces for metrics collection
   - Implemented collectors for different metric types (counters, gauges, histograms)
   - Created agent-specific metrics collection

2. **Metrics Storage**
   - Developed in-memory and persistent storage options
   - Implemented querying capabilities for metric retrieval
   - Added summary statistics generation

3. **Campaign Performance Tracking**
   - Created specialized metrics for ad campaigns
   - Implemented performance metrics calculation (CTR, CVR, CPA, ROAS)
   - Added time series analysis for campaign performance

4. **Observability Framework**
   - Developed interfaces for observable agents and monitoring
   - Implemented health checks and status reporting
   - Created alerting system for detecting issues
   - Built system-wide monitoring capabilities

5. **Integration with Communication Protocol**
   - Extended agents with observability features
   - Added metrics collection to message processing
   - Implemented performance tracking for agent tasks

## Key Technical Decisions

### Agent Architecture

1. **Agent Types**
   - **BaseAgent**: Core interface for all agents
   - **SetupAgent**: For one-time setup tasks
   - **OperationalAgent**: For ongoing operations
   - **CommunicatingAgent**: For agents that exchange messages

2. **Communication Protocol**
   - Message-based asynchronous communication
   - Centralized MessageBroker for routing
   - Conversation tracking across messages
   - Priority-based message processing

3. **Agent State Management**
   - Agents maintain their own state
   - State is exposed through the observability interface
   - State changes are tracked for debugging

### Testing Approach

1. **Test Types**
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - Example-based tests for agent interactions

2. **Test Data**
   - Fixtures for common test objects
   - In-memory storage for tests
   - Reproducible test scenarios

### Metrics and Observability

1. **Metric Types**
   - Counters for cumulative values
   - Gauges for current values
   - Histograms for distributions
   - Events for discrete occurrences

2. **Storage Options**
   - In-memory for development and testing
   - SQLite for persistence
   - Extensible design for future database options

3. **Health Monitoring**
   - Health status determination
   - Issue detection and reporting
   - System-wide monitoring
   - Alerting for critical issues

## Lessons Learned

1. **Interface-First Development**
   - Defining clear interfaces before implementation helped ensure proper separation of concerns
   - Enabled parallel development of different components
   - Made testing easier with clear contracts

2. **Agent Granularity**
   - Specialized agents with focused responsibilities worked better than general-purpose agents
   - Task-specific agents were easier to test and reason about
   - Collaboration between specialized agents provided flexibility

3. **Testing Importance**
   - Early investment in testing infrastructure paid off in faster debugging
   - Test fixtures reduced duplication and improved consistency
   - Integration tests caught issues that unit tests missed

4. **Observability from the Start**
   - Building in metrics and monitoring from the beginning provided invaluable insights
   - Health checks helped identify potential issues early
   - Performance tracking informed optimization decisions

## Next Steps

### Phase 5: Process Framework Integration (Planned)

1. **APQC Process Integration**
   - Map agents to standard business processes
   - Implement process state tracking
   - Create process visualization

2. **eTOM Framework Alignment**
   - Integrate telecommunications industry standards
   - Implement eTOM-specific processes
   - Create cross-mapping between APQC and eTOM

### Phase 6: TISIT Second Brain Development (Planned)
