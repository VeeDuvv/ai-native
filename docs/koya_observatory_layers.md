# Koya Observatory: Hierarchical Observability Layers

## Fifth Grade Explanation:
This document explains how different bosses in our AI advertising company can see different things. The human CEO can see everything, while other AI bosses only see what their team is doing, like how a school principal can see the whole school but teachers only see their own classrooms.

## High School Explanation:
This document details the hierarchical observability model for Koya's agent monitoring system, defining the five distinct layers of access and visibility corresponding to our organizational structure. Each executive has visibility appropriate to their role and responsibilities, with comprehensive oversight reserved for the CEO.

## Cross-Layer Visibility Rules

### Information Flow Principles
1. **Vertical Access**: Each executive has full visibility of their direct reports
2. **Horizontal Summarization**: Executives receive summarized information from peer domains
3. **Upward Detail**: All detailed information is available to higher layers
4. **Downward Relevance**: Lower layers receive only information relevant to their function
5. **Context Preservation**: Sufficient context is provided across boundaries to enable meaningful understanding

### Permissions Structure
- Layer 1 (CEO) can access all information and override any decision
- Layer 2 (CTO) can access all technical data and intervene in technical operations
- Layers 3-5 (Domain Executives) can fully control their domain and receive relevant summaries from other domains
- Each executive can grant temporary expanded visibility to their agents for specific projects
- Cross-domain collaboration triggers automatic visibility sharing for relevant information
- Client-specific information maintains consistent privacy controls across all layers

### Alert Escalation
- Domain-specific issues are surfaced within that domain's observatory
- Cross-domain issues are surfaced to all relevant executive observatories
- Critical issues are automatically escalated to CEO and CTO observatories
- Pattern-based anomalies trigger visibility expansion to enable root cause analysis
- Decision bottlenecks automatically highlight to the appropriate executive layer
- Client-impacting issues simultaneously alert Front Office and relevant domain executives
