## Task Details

### Define the core architecture for our AI-native ad agency
- Status: Completed
- Priority: High
- Outcome: Created system_architecture.md defining the core components:
  - Agent Ecosystem (Strategy, Creative, Media, Analytics, Client Communication)
  - Central Orchestration Layer
  - Knowledge Repository
  - API Gateway
  - Agent Observability Framework
- Created agent_types.md classifying agents as:
  - Setup Agents (one-time tasks)
  - Operational Agents (recurring processes)

### Create a roadmap for MVP development
- Status: Completed
- Priority: High
- Outcome: Created mvp_roadmap.md defining:
