# Koya Architecture: Guiding Principles & Blueprint

## Fifth Grade Explanation:
This document explains how we'll build our AI advertising helpers' brains. It's like a blueprint that shows what each helper needs to remember, what actions they can take, and how they make decisions.

## High School Explanation:
This document establishes the core architectural principles for Koya's AI agent system, integrating concepts from the CoALA cognitive architecture framework and OpenAI's practical guide to building agents. It defines the foundational components that will inform our technical implementation across memory systems, action spaces, and decision procedures.

# Architectural Foundations: Integrating CoALA and OpenAI's Framework

## Core Principles

Our architecture for Koya's AI-native advertising agency is built on these fundamental principles:

1. **Cognitive Coherence**: Each agent embodies a complete cognitive architecture with memory, action, and decision components working as an integrated system.

2. **Practical Implementation**: Theoretical components are mapped to concrete implementation approaches with clear technical guidance.

3. **Role Specialization**: Agent architectures are tailored to specific functional roles within the advertising value chain.

4. **Observable Operation**: All agent components and processes are designed for transparency and monitoring.

5. **Hierarchical Structure**: Agents operate within a clear organizational hierarchy with defined communication patterns.

6. **Continuous Learning**: The system evolves through systematic knowledge acquisition and pattern recognition.

7. **Human Collaboration**: Architecture supports meaningful human-AI partnership with appropriate intervention points.

## Architectural Components from CoALA

From the Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents (CoALA) framework, we adopt these core structural elements:

### 1. Memory Systems

**Working Memory**
