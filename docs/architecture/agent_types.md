# AI-Native Ad Agency: Agent Types

## Overview

Agents in our AI-native architecture can be classified based on their lifecycle and execution frequency. Understanding these distinctions helps us design appropriate agent interfaces, lifecycle management, and orchestration mechanisms.

## Agent Classifications

### 1. Setup Agents (One-time Tasks)

Setup Agents are responsible for initialization and configuration tasks that typically execute once or very infrequently during the lifecycle of the system.

**Characteristics:**
- Execute during system initialization or major transitions
- May become dormant after completing their tasks
- Often create resources or configurations used by operational agents
- May have elevated permissions for initial system setup

**Example Setup Agents:**
- Business Registration Agent: Handles legal entity creation and documentation
- Infrastructure Deployment Agent: Sets up cloud resources and services
- Knowledge Base Initialization Agent: Seeds initial data structures and repositories
- Model Training Agent: Performs initial training of AI models
- User/Client Onboarding Agent: Creates initial client accounts and configurations
- Website/Platform Setup Agent: Initializes web presence and digital storefront

**Lifecycle Management:**
- Clear success/failure states
- May include rollback capabilities
- Progress tracking for long-running setup processes
- Detailed audit logging of all setup actions

### 2. Operational Agents (Recurring Processes)

Operational Agents handle the day-to-day business processes and are invoked continuously or on a regular schedule throughout the system's lifecycle.

**Characteristics:**
- Execute repeatedly as part of normal business operations
- Remain active throughout the system lifecycle
- Focus on core business value creation
- Often operate on resources created by setup agents

**Example Operational Agents:**
- Campaign Strategy Agent: Develops advertising campaign strategies
- Creative Development Agent: Generates and refines advertising content
- Media Buying Agent: Manages ad placements and budget allocation
- Analytics Agent: Monitors campaign performance and generates insights
- Client Communication Agent: Handles ongoing client interactions
- Compliance Monitoring Agent: Ensures regulatory adherence

**Lifecycle Management:**
- Stateful operation with persistence between invocations
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Version management and seamless upgrades
- Load balancing and scaling based on demand

## System Integration Considerations

### Orchestration Differences

Setup and operational agents require different orchestration approaches:

1. **Setup Orchestration:**
   - Sequential execution with dependencies
   - Progress tracking and reporting
   - Comprehensive error handling and rollback
   - One-time or triggered execution

2. **Operational Orchestration:**
   - Continuous availability or scheduled execution
   - Resource allocation and load balancing
   - Performance optimization
   - Seamless version transitions

### Knowledge Sharing

Information flow between setup and operational agents:

1. **Setup → Operational:**
   - Configuration parameters
   - Resource locations and access credentials
   - Initial data sets and knowledge bases
   - Business rules and constraints

2. **Operational → Setup:**
   - Feedback for system reconfiguration
   - Performance metrics for optimization
   - New requirements for system expansion

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing agents, consider the following:

1. **Clear Classification:**
   - Explicitly designate each agent as setup or operational
   - Document the expected lifecycle and execution frequency

2. **Appropriate Interfaces:**
   - Design interfaces suitable for the agent's classification
   - Include appropriate lifecycle hooks and state management

3. **Observability:**
   - Implement monitoring appropriate to the agent type
   - Ensure setup agents produce detailed audit logs
   - Provide real-time metrics for operational agents

4. **Resource Management:**
   - Ensure setup agents release resources after completion
   - Optimize resource utilization for long-running operational agents

## Future Considerations

As the system evolves, we may identify additional agent classifications or hybrid types:

- **Maintenance Agents:** Periodic but infrequent system maintenance tasks
- **Upgrade Agents:** Managing system-wide transitions and updates
- **Recovery Agents:** Handling disaster recovery and system restoration
