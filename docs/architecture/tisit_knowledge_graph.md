# Fifth Grade Explanation:
# This file explains how TISIT will remember important words and ideas for our project.
# It's like making a special dictionary where all the words are connected to each other
# in a web, so we can find the information we need quickly.

# High School Explanation:
# This document outlines the architecture for TISIT's knowledge graph implementation.
# It details how we'll capture, store, and relate important terms, technologies, 
# frameworks, and people relevant to our project to create a queryable knowledge base.

# TISIT: Knowledge Graph Implementation

## Core Concept

TISIT (This Is What It Is) will function as a comprehensive knowledge graph of technical terms, frameworks, packages, concepts, and people relevant to our AI-native project. By explicitly capturing and connecting these entities, we create a queryable resource that represents "what we know" and the relationships between different pieces of knowledge.

## Knowledge Entity Structure

Each captured entity in TISIT will have the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-identifier",
  "name": "Entity Name",
  "type": "framework|package|concept|person|company|term",
  "short_description": "One-sentence summary",
  "detailed_description": "Comprehensive explanation",
  "first_encountered": "ISO-8601 date",
  "last_updated": "ISO-8601 date",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
  "links": [
    {
      "relation_type": "depends_on|created_by|similar_to|part_of|etc",
      "target_id": "another-entity-id",
      "description": "Explanation of the relationship"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "official_url": "https://example.com",
    "documentation": "https://docs.example.com",
    "version": "If applicable",
    "github_url": "If applicable",
    "custom_fields": {}
  },
  "references": [
    {
      "type": "internal|external",
      "location": "File path or URL",
      "context": "How/where this was referenced"
    }
  ]
}
```

## System Components

### 1. Knowledge Capture System

**Automated Capture**
- Parser that identifies potential knowledge entities in code and documentation
- Integration with development environment to flag new terms
- Monitoring of project communications for relevant terms

**Manual Capture**
- Simple CLI command: `tisit add <entity_name> --type <type>`
- Web interface for adding and editing entities
- Special comment format in code to document new entities

### 2. Knowledge Storage

**Entity Database**
- JSON document store for entity definitions
- Full-text search capabilities
- Version history tracking

**Relationship Database**
- Graph database to store connections between entities
- Support for typed relationships
- Bi-directional relationship traversal

### 3. Knowledge Retrieval

**Query Interface**
- Simple CLI command: `tisit find <query>`
- Natural language query processing
- Structured query language for complex searches

**Visualization**
- Interactive knowledge graph visualization
- Relationship exploration tools
- Custom views based on entity types or relationships

### 4. Integration Points

**Development Environment**
- IDE plugins to access TISIT while coding
- Hover-over documentation from TISIT entities
- Quick-add functionality for new terms

**Documentation System**
- Automatic linking of terms in documentation
- Entity summaries embeddable in docs
- Documentation generation from TISIT data

**Agent Framework**
- Knowledge source for agents
- Context provision for decision-making
- Learning target for new discoveries

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Data Structure

**Entity Storage Format**
- Use JSON files in a Git-tracked directory structure
- Organize by entity type and first letter
- One file per entity for easy diffing and updates

**Relationship Representation**
- Store relationships in both entity definitions (for simplicity)
- Maintain a separate relationship index for efficient queries
- Use typed edges with optional properties

### 2. File Organization

```
/tisit/
  /entities/
    /frameworks/
      /a/
        angular.json
        aws-lambda.json
      /b/
        bootstrap.json
    /packages/
      /a/
        anthropic.json
      /p/
        pydantic.json
    /people/
      /d/
        duvvuri-vamsi.json
    /concepts/
      /a/
        agent-architecture.json
  /indexes/
    term-index.json
    relationship-index.json
    tag-index.json
  /scripts/
    add-entity.py
    update-entity.py
    query.py
    visualize.py
```

### 3. Capture Workflow

1. **Identification**: Entity is identified (manually or automatically)
2. **Creation**: Basic entity record is created with name, type, and description
3. **Enrichment**: Additional metadata and links are added
4. **Validation**: Entity is checked for completeness and consistency
5. **Publishing**: Entity is committed to the knowledge base
6. **Indexing**: Search and relationship indexes are updated

### 4. Retrieval Workflow

1. **Query Formation**: User specifies search terms or criteria
2. **Entity Matching**: System identifies relevant entities
3. **Relationship Expansion**: Related entities are discovered
4. **Result Ranking**: Entities are sorted by relevance
5. **Presentation**: Results are displayed in appropriate format
6. **Refinement**: User can filter or expand results

## Usage Patterns

### 1. Onboarding New Concepts

When encountering a new framework, package, or concept:

```bash
# Quick add with interactive prompts for details
tisit add "React" --type framework

# Add with immediate description
tisit add "Redux" --type framework --desc "State management library for JavaScript applications"

# Add with relationship
tisit add "Redux" --type framework --relates-to "React:works_with"
```

### 2. Knowledge Exploration

To explore existing knowledge:

```bash
# Basic search
tisit find "React"

# Type-specific search
tisit find --type framework

# Relationship exploration
tisit find "React" --related

# Visualization
tisit visualize "React" --depth 2
```

### 3. Documentation Integration

In documentation files:

```markdown
# Component Architecture

Our system uses the [[tisit:React]] framework with a [[tisit:Redux]] state management approach.
```

The documentation system would expand these references with links and tooltips.

## Initial Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Structure

1. Create the basic entity data structure
2. Implement simple file-based storage
3. Develop CLI add and find commands
4. Establish basic Git integration

### Phase 2: Relationship Management

1. Implement relationship data structure
2. Create relationship visualization
3. Add relationship queries
4. Develop relationship suggestion

### Phase 3: Integration

1. Create documentation integration
2. Implement IDE plugins
3. Develop agent integration
4. Build web interface

## Maintenance Processes

1. **Regular Reviews**: Scheduled reviews of entities for accuracy
2. **Orphan Detection**: Identifying disconnected entities
3. **Suggestion System**: Recommending potential relationships
4. **Usage Tracking**: Monitoring which entities are queried
5. **Expansion Prompts**: Suggesting areas for knowledge expansion

## Success Metrics

TISIT will be successful when:

1. New terms are consistently captured
2. Knowledge retrieval is faster than web searching
3. Documentation automatically incorporates knowledge
4. Project members have a shared understanding of terminology
5. Knowledge gaps are easily identified

## Conclusion

This knowledge graph implementation of TISIT provides a structured way to capture and relate important terms, technologies, frameworks, and people relevant to our project. By maintaining this graph, we create a valuable resource that grows with the project and supports both human understanding and agent operations.
