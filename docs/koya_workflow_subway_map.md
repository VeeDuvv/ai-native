# Koya Workflow Subway Map Visualization

## Fifth Grade Explanation:
This is like a subway map that shows how our AI helpers work together. Different colored lines show different types of projects, and the stations show where work moves from one helper to another.

## High School Explanation:
This document outlines the design for a subway-style visualization of Koya's agent workflows and handoffs. It leverages the familiarity and intuitiveness of transit maps to represent complex workflow processes, making it easier to understand how work progresses through the agency's specialized agents.

## Concept Overview

The Koya Workflow Subway Map transforms our complex agent workflows into an intuitive, transit-inspired visualization that enables executives and team members to easily track campaign progress, identify bottlenecks, and understand workflow patterns. This approach takes advantage of the human brain's ability to quickly process transit maps to visualize complex, interconnected systems.

## Design Principles

1. **Clarity Through Abstraction**: Simplify complex workflows into clean, geometric lines and nodes
2. **Intuitive Color Coding**: Use distinct colors to represent different workflow types
3. **Hierarchical Information**: Provide overview at a glance with drill-down capabilities
4. **Real-Time Status**: Show active workflows and handoffs as they occur
5. **Spatial Organization**: Group agents by function (front, middle, back office)
6. **Temporal Progression**: Generally flow from left to right to indicate timeline
7. **Interactive Navigation**: Allow users to explore and focus on specific areas

## Core Visualization Elements

### 1. Line Design

Each "subway line" represents a distinct workflow type or campaign category.

#### Line Types:
- **Brand Campaign Line** (Red): Full marketing campaigns with all agency services
- **Digital Campaign Line** (Blue): Digital-focused campaigns with emphasis on online channels
- **Content Production Line** (Green): Content-centric workflows with emphasis on creative assets
- **Social Media Line** (Yellow): Social media campaign workflows
- **Analytics Line** (Purple): Data-driven research and reporting workflows
- **Client Service Line** (Orange): Account management and client relationship workflows
- **Express Lines** (Dashed): Expedited workflows for urgent projects
- **Circular Line** (Loop): Ongoing retainer work that cycles regularly

#### Line Visualization:
- Thick, smooth curves with rounded corners (subway style)
- Distinctive colors with adequate contrast
- Parallel tracks where multiple campaigns follow similar paths
- Line width can indicate workflow volume or importance
- Dashed variations indicate special workflow types (expedited, experimental)

### 2. Station Design

"Stations" represent agents or key decision points in the workflow process.

#### Station Types:
- **Agent Stations**: Primary nodes representing each of the 26 specialized agents
- **Decision Stations**: Diamond-shaped nodes indicating key decision points
- **Gateway Stations**: Major handoff points between front/middle/back office
- **Integration Stations**: Points where multiple workflows converge
- **Terminal Stations**: Starting and ending points of workflows
- **Express Stations**: Points where workflows can skip steps for expedited processing

#### Station Visualization:
- Circular nodes with agent icon and abbreviated name
- Size indicates agent capacity or importance in workflow
- Border color represents office association (front/middle/back)
- Inner color indicates current status (active, idle, overloaded)
- Badge indicators for special conditions or alerts
- Station "platforms" can show queued work items

### 3. Connection Visualization

The connections between stations represent handoffs and information flow.

#### Connection Types:
- **Standard Transfers**: Normal handoffs between agents
- **Express Connections**: Direct, expedited handoffs
- **Conditional Transfers**: Dotted lines showing potential paths based on decisions
- **Bidirectional Flows**: Two-way exchanges between agents
- **Cross-Line Transfers**: Workflows that jump between different campaign types
- **Interchanges**: Major connection points with multiple possible paths

#### Connection Visualization:
- Smooth, curved lines connecting stations
- Line thickness indicating volume of handoffs
- Animated dots showing active work items in transit
- Flow direction indicators (arrows) where needed
- Glowing effects for active or high-priority transfers
- Warning indicators for delayed or problematic handoffs
