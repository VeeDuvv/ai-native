# Koya Action Space Mapping

## Fifth Grade Explanation:
This document shows what each AI helper in our advertising company can do. It connects their jobs (like writing ads or buying ad space) with the computer parts that make those actions possible.

## High School Explanation:
This document maps the specific advertising activities in our value chain to the technical action spaces required to execute them, while positioning memory systems and decision procedures as horizontal capabilities that support all actions across the agency.

# Koya Action Space: Mapping Activities to Technical Architecture

## Action Space Framework

Koya's action space represents the set of all possible actions our agents can take across the advertising value chain. We can visualize this as a matrix where:

- **Vertical axis**: Specific advertising activities performed by specialized agents
- **Horizontal axis**: Memory and decision capabilities that support all activities

This mapping creates a comprehensive blueprint for what our agents do and how those activities are technically enabled.

This comprehensive mapping demonstrates how each advertising activity in our value chain connects to specific technical actions, all supported by the horizontal capabilities of memory systems and decision procedures. By organizing our architecture this way, we maintain clear separation between what our agents do (domain-specific activities) and how they do it (technical implementations).
