# AI-Native Ad Agency: MVP Development Roadmap

## MVP Vision

Our MVP will deliver a functional AI-native advertising agency platform that demonstrates the core value proposition: AI agents working together to create, manage, and optimize advertising campaigns with minimal human intervention.

### MVP Goals

1. Prove the viability of our agent-first architecture
2. Deliver measurable value to early adopters
3. Generate learnings for future development
4. Establish foundation for rapid iteration

   - Lifecycle management system
   - Basic agent state persistence
   - Agent registration and discovery

2. **Central Orchestration System**
   - Task delegation mechanism
   - Agent coordination primitives
   - Basic workflow engine
   - Error handling framework

3. **Knowledge Repository Foundation**
   - Data storage architecture
   - Schema definitions
   - Access control mechanisms
   - Initial seeding process

4. **API Gateway Skeleton**
   - Authentication framework
   - Request routing
   - Rate limiting
   - API documentation

5. **Observability Foundations**
   - Logging infrastructure
   - Basic metrics collection
   - Agent activity tracking
   - Simple dashboard views

#### Setup Agents to Implement:

1. **Infrastructure Setup Agent**
   - Provisions necessary cloud resources
   - Configures networking and security
   - Sets up databases and storage
   - Establishes monitoring

2. **Knowledge Base Initialization Agent**
   - Seeds initial advertising knowledge
   - Imports industry benchmarks
   - Creates starter templates
   - Establishes taxonomy

### Phase 2: Core Capabilities (Weeks 5-8)

Implement the minimal set of operational agents needed to execute a simplified advertising campaign workflow.

#### Key Deliverables:

1. **Basic Campaign Strategy Agent**
   - Campaign objective definition
   - Target audience identification
   - Budget allocation recommendations
   - Simple campaign planning

2. **Creative Generation Agent v1**
   - Text ad creation (headlines, descriptions)
   - Basic image suggestion
   - Creative template application
   - Simple A/B variant generation

3. **Simplified Media Planning Agent**
   - Channel recommendation
   - Basic budget allocation
   - Campaign scheduling
   - Simple performance projections

4. **User Interface - Admin**
   - Agent configuration dashboard
   - System monitoring views
   - Manual intervention controls
   - Debug and testing tools

5. **Interagent Communication**
   - Message passing implementation
   - Standardized protocol definition
   - Request-response patterns
   - Event notification system

### Phase 3: Integration & Polish (Weeks 9-12)

Connect the components into a cohesive whole and implement the client-facing interfaces.

#### Key Deliverables:

1. **Client Communication Agent**
   - Requirement collection
   - Progress updates
   - Result presentation
   - Feedback collection

2. **End-to-End Workflow**
   - Campaign creation to delivery
   - Handoffs between agents
   - Status tracking
   - Error recovery

3. **User Interface - Client**
   - Campaign request interface
   - Status monitoring
   - Result viewing
   - Feedback submission

4. **Basic Analytics Agent**
   - Performance data collection
   - Simple reporting
   - Basic insights generation
   - Trend identification

5. **Documentation & Onboarding**
   - User guides
   - API documentation
   - System architecture
   - Onboarding process

## Technical Dependencies

### External Services

1. **AI/ML Models**
   - OpenAI/Claude APIs for language tasks
   - Stable Diffusion or similar for image generation
   - Sentiment analysis services
   - Industry-specific models as needed

2. **Data Sources**
   - Industry benchmarks
   - Market research APIs
   - Ad platform integrations
   - Media pricing sources

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Cloud hosting (AWS/GCP/Azure)
   - Database services
   - Message queue system
   - Authentication provider

### Internal Dependencies

1. **Agent Framework → Agent Implementation**
   - Core agent definitions must be stable before building specific agents
   - Agent lifecycle management needed for reliable operation

2. **Orchestration → End-to-End Workflow**
   - Task delegation system required before agents can cooperate
   - Workflow engine needed to coordinate complex processes

3. **Knowledge Repository → Operational Agents**
   - Data schema must be defined before agents can effectively use it
   - Access patterns established for efficient knowledge retrieval

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team

- 2-3 Backend Engineers
- 1-2 AI/ML Specialists
- 1 Frontend Developer
- 1 DevOps Engineer
- 1 Product Manager

### Infrastructure

- Development environment
- Testing/Staging environment
- Production environment
- CI/CD pipeline
- Monitoring system

## Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful when:

1. **Functional Completeness**
   - All Phase 1-3 deliverables implemented
   - End-to-end workflow operational
   - Core agents functioning as specified

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Agent response times under acceptable thresholds
   - System stability at projected initial load
   - Error rates below defined maximums

3. **Business Outcomes**
   - 5+ completed campaigns through the system
   - Positive feedback from initial clients
   - Measurable time/cost savings compared to traditional process

## Post-MVP Roadmap Preview
