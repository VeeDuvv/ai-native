# AI-Native Ad Agency

> Building the future of advertising with AI-first principles

## Overview

This repository contains the architecture, design, and implementation of an AI-native advertising agency platform. We're creating a system where autonomous AI agents collaborate to plan, create, and optimize advertising campaigns with minimal human intervention.

## Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize the advertising industry by building a truly AI-native platform that leverages the power of autonomous agents while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to changing requirements and technologies.

## Core Principles

- **Agent-First Architecture**: Autonomous AI agents as first-class citizens
- **API-First Design**: All functionality built as APIs first, interfaces second
- **Extensibility Over Optimization**: Prioritizing the ability to extend our system
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clean separation between system components
- **Data-Driven Evolution**: System learns and improves based on its own operation
- **Minimizing Technical Debt**: Long-term focus over short-term gains
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Designing for effective collaboration

## Repository Structure

- `docs/`: Documentation for architecture, planning, and processes
  - `architecture/`: System architecture and component design
  - `planning/`: Development roadmap and planning documents
