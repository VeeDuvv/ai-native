# Fifth Grade Explanation:
# This file tells the computer that the api_layer folder is a special package of code
# that all works together. It's like putting a label on a box of toys so you know
# what's inside.

# application. It serves as the entry point to the API layer and exposes the version
# and basic metadata about the API implementation.
