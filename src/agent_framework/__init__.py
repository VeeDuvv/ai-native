# Fifth Grade Explanation:
# This file tells the computer that the agent_framework folder is special and contains 
# code that works together. It's like putting a sign on a clubhouse that says "This is 
# our club" so everyone knows what's inside.

# This module initializes the agent_framework package, making it accessible to import
# throughout the application. It defines the package's public interface and version 
# information, exposing only the components intended for external use.
